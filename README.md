# STM32F-DC-Motor-Control-with-PID-and-Ziegler-Nichols-Method
This project includes Ziegler Nichols methods source code for PID parameters optimization real-time.

Ziegler Nichols helps to find system behaviour without transfer function.

If you do not know the parameters which are help to calculate transfer function of system.

This method will help the optimize PID control of system.

Depend on Ziegler Nichols formula;

Kp = 1,2 * T/L
Ki = 2 * L
Kd = 0,5 * L

l_time refers to L 
t_time refers to T

In anytime system will calculate L and T. Using this time parameters PID parameters will be updated.

Variable names are Turkish. Will be updated...
